# Barbecue

## Overview
This repository contains container images that can mimic the behavior of a Trento agent. These container images are primarily used for testing-focused containerized agents within the Trento project.

## Purpose
The main purpose of the trento-project/barbecue repository is to provide a set of containerized agents that can be used to simulate the behavior of Trento agents in a controlled environment. This allows developers and administrators to test and validate the functionality of the Trento system without the need for a live SAP system.

## Key Features

- **Simulated SAP Monitoring**: The container images are designed to mimic the monitoring capabilities of the Trento agents, allowing users to test the system's response to various scenarios without the need for a live SAP system.
- **Customization**: The container images can be customized to suit the specific needs of the user, such as simulating different types of SAP systems or monitoring scenarios.
